# Data Science Exercises

## Description

I will be posting and saving my practices/exercises from various sources. Practice includes Numpy, Pandas, SQL, Machine Learing, etc.
Some of resources are:
* machinelearningplus.com
* https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/77/
* https://iainpardoe.com/arm3e/learning-resources/quizzes/ (Linear Regression)

I am planning on doing these practices/exercises as I take courses on machinelearningplus.com. This project aims to enhance my programming skills in data analysis.
